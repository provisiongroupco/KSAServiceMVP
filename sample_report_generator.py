    'equipment_details': '''Hood Model: Halton KVL-3000
Serial Number: HLT-2024-KSA-1234
Installation Date: January 15, 2024
Location: Main Kitchen, Section A

The equipment is a commercial kitchen ventilation hood system with integrated UV-C technology for grease elimination. The system includes variable air volume (VAV) controls and M.A.R.V.E.L. demand-controlled ventilation.''',
    'work_performed': '''1. Performed complete inspection of hood system and exhaust fans
2. Cleaned and replaced all grease filters (6 units)
3. Inspected and tested UV-C lamps - all functioning within specifications
4. Checked and calibrated VAV controls and sensors
5. Cleaned hood surfaces and interior chambers
6. Tested fire suppression system linkage and controls
7. Verified exhaust fan operation and balanced airflow
8. Lubricated fan bearings and checked belt tension
9. Inspected and cleaned make-up air units
10. Updated maintenance log and system documentation''',
    'findings': '''During the inspection, the following observations were made:

1. All UV-C lamps are functioning properly with expected UV output levels
2. Grease filters showed normal accumulation for 3-month service interval
3. VAV controls responding correctly to kitchen demand
4. Minor adjustment needed on exhaust fan belt tension - completed
5. Fire suppression system test successful - all components operational
6. Make-up air balance within design specifications
7. No unusual noise or vibration detected in fan systems
8. Control panel displays all systems normal

Overall system condition: GOOD
The ventilation system is operating within design parameters and manufacturer specifications.''',
    'recommendations': '''Based on today's service visit, we recommend the following:

1. Continue with quarterly preventive maintenance schedule
2. Replace UV-C lamps at next service visit (6-month interval)
3. Consider upgrading to Halton Connect IoT monitoring system for real-time performance tracking
4. Schedule annual fire suppression system certification with authorized provider
5. Maintain current filter replacement schedule (quarterly)

No immediate repairs or replacements are required. The system is performing optimally.''',
